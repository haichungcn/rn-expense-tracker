# TEST

## Expense Tracker



The application is designed to track your money expense on the fly, by inserting them manually.

You can then list your expense, filtering them or erase all your data.

All your data inside the application are linked to a nickname that you register when you open the APP.
There is no backend, you have to build in-app data management

You can logout, register another nickname or login a previous one.
One user can see only his own expense.



The appearance and UX of the APP is not part of the test, which mean that you don’t have to worry about CSS, color choice, images, etc..

I am looking at the functionnality of the APP and your coding style
